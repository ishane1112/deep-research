## Typographical rules

Follow these rules to organize your output:

- **Title:** Use \`#\` to create article title.
- **Headings:** Use \`##\` through \`######\` to create headings of different levels.
- **Paragraphs:** Use blank lines to separate paragraphs.
- **Bold emphasis (required):** Use asterisks to highlight **important** content from the rest of the text.
- **Links:** Use \`[link text](URL)\` to insert links.
- **Lists:**
    - **Unordered lists:** Use \`*\`, \`-\`, or \`+\` followed by a space.
    - **Ordered lists:** Use \`1.\`, \`2.\`, etc., and a period.
* **Code:**
    - **Inline code:** Enclose it in backticks (\` \`).
    - **Code blocks:** Enclose it in triple backticks (\`\`\` \`\`\`), optionally in a language.
- **Quotes:** Use the \`>\` symbol.
- **Horizontal rule:** Use \`---\`, \`***\` or \`___\`.
- **Table**: Use basic GFM table syntax, do not include any extra spaces or tabs for alignment, and use \`|\` and \`-\` symbols to construct. **For complex tables, GFM table syntax is not suitable. You must use HTML syntax to output complex tables.**
- **Emoji:** You can insert Emoji before the title or subtitle, such as \`🔢### 1. Determine the base area of the prism\`.
- **LaTeX:**
    - **Inline formula:** Use \`$E=mc^2$\`
    - **Block-level formula (preferred):** Use \`$$E=mc^2$$\` to display the formula in the center.

## Generate Mermaid

1. Use Mermaid's graph TD (Top-Down) or graph LR (Left-Right) type.
2. Create a unique node ID for each identified entity (must use English letters or abbreviations as IDs), and display the full name or key description of the entity in the node shape (e.g., PersonA[Alice], OrgB[XYZ Company]).
3. Relationships are represented as edges with labels, and the labels indicate the type of relationship (e.g., A --> |"Relationship Type"| B).
4. Respond with ONLY the Mermaid code (including block), and no additional text before or after.
5. Please focus on the most core entities in the article and the most important relationships between them, and ensure that the generated graph is concise and easy to understand.
6. All text content **MUST** be wrapped in \`"\` syntax. (e.g., "Any Text Content")
7. You need to double-check that all content complies with Mermaid syntax, especially that all text needs to be wrapped in \`"\`.

**Customer Potential Evaluation Report**

**1. Identity & Role Identification:**
   - Based on their website's content (e.g., "products", "services", "solutions", "about us"), identify the customer's primary role.
   - Are they an **End-User** (using machines for their own production, e.g., a fabrication shop) or a **Distributor/Dealer** (selling machinery to local customers)?
   - **Identified Role**: [End-User/Distributor/Uncertain]
   - **Reasoning**: [Provide a brief justification based on website evidence.]

**2. Business & Product Match (Score 1-10):**
   - **For End-Users:** Does their business involve sheet metal fabrication (bending, cutting, etc.)? Do they showcase products or projects that would require our machinery?
   - **For Distributors:** Do they sell machinery in a related field (e.g., metalworking, CNC, industrial equipment)? Do they list product categories similar to ours?
   - **Score**: 
   - **Analysis**: [Detail the connection between their business and our products.]

**3. Company Scale & Financial Strength (Score 1-10):**
   - Assess their scale based on information like "number of employees", "facility size", "global presence/branches", "company history", and "press releases".
   - **Score**: 
   - **Observations**: [List key indicators of their scale and strength.]

**4. Market & Industry Influence (Score 1-10):**
   - Do they list well-known partners or customers? 
   - **For Distributors:** Do they represent other reputable machinery brands (especially our competitors)? This indicates strong market access.
   - Do they have case studies, a gallery of projects, or a news/blog section that demonstrates activity and influence?
   - **Score**:
   - **Assessment**: [Summarize their industry standing and resources.]

**5. Final Recommendation & Score:**
   - **Total Score**: [Sum of scores from sections 2, 3, and 4. Max: 30]
   - **One-Line Justification**: [A concise summary of why they are or are not a good potential customer.]
   - **Next Step Recommendation**: [e.g., "High priority follow-up by sales team", "Add to nurturing list for future contact", "Low priority, discard".]

Based on this, ask questions that help prioritize the research. For example:
- Should we focus on identifying their current manufacturing capabilities to see if they are a potential End-User?
- Is it more important to determine if they sell related machinery, suggesting they could be a Distributor?
- Should the initial research prioritize their company size and market presence?
